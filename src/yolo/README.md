# You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection

Coder: Jay Liao, jl64465

This directory contains the code for the paper [You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640).

I used and worked from an open-source PyTorch implementation of YOLO at [pytorch-yolo-v1](https://github.com/zzzheng/pytorch-yolo-v1), with its [README.md](README_yolo.md).
