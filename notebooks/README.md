This is the coding assignment for Mask R-CNN, which was not successfully done. I used an open source code in the following link, I modified the code a little bit, and trained the Mask R-CNN model on VOC_2012, VOC_2007 datasets. <br/>https://bjornkhansen95.medium.com/mask-r-cnn-for-segmentation-using-pytorch-8bbfa8511883 <br/>

However, when the code was running on Colab under GPU/High RAM settings, there was always one error saying that an illegal cuda memory was encountered. If I change the setting to CPU, the program runs smoothly but extremely slow. Therefore, I only trained my Mask R-CNN model on a small portion of VOC_2012 and VOC_2007 datasets for two epoches respectively. The following pictures are my results.
